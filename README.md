# AI-Travel-Assistant
I Travel Planner is a Java-based desktop application leveraging the Swing toolkit and OpenAIâ€™s API to intelligently generate personalized travel plans, itineraries, and activity suggestions. By integrating natural language processing with a responsive graphical interface, the application allows users to input preferences, destinations, and constraints, then dynamically produces context-aware travel recommendations. The system utilizes a modular architecture featuring custom Swing components, HTTP client networking, and JSON parsing, enabling seamless interaction with OpenAI's language models for real-time itinerary generation. This project demonstrates the intersection of AI-assisted decision making and traditional GUI-based software, offering a scalable foundation for advanced travel planning tools.
